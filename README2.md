I think a BLT sounds good. Don't you?

### Gather Our Items
#### Before we do anything, we need to gather what we need for our BLT. Luckily, we don't need to go to the store and have everything we need right here at home.

1. Wash your hands with warm soapy water.
2. Pull cutting board from the cabinet and place on the counter.
3. Get a knife from the chopping block and place on the counter next to the cutting board.
4. Get a butter knife from the cutlery drawer and place it on the counter next to the cutting board.
5. Set a ripe tomato next to the cutting board on the counter.
6. Gather bacon, lettuce, and mayo from the fridge. I'm using Iceburg lettuce, but use whatever you like. If you don't like mayo, you can leave it out.
7. Pull your bread out of the pantry and set it on the counter near your produce.
8. Place the bacon next to the burner you are going to use.
9. Place the lettuce next to the cutting board on the counter.
10. Get a pan from the cabinet and place it on your selected burner. 
11. If, like me, you don't keep your toaster on your counter, pull it out, place it near an outlet on your counter and plug it in.

### Prep Work
#### Does anybody like raw bacon? If you do, you can skip the part where we cook the bacon. You can also know I am judging you a little bit ü´∂üèª

1. Turn your burner on medium high heat.
2. Open the bacon package.
3. Pull 3-4 strips of bacon out of the package and place them inside your pan, depending on how many will fit.
4. Let those cook until desired crispiness, flipping one time halfway through. I like mine on the more crispy side.
5. While they are cooking, let's take our lettuce out of its package and wash it.
6. Shake off the excess water and place back on the counter next to the cutting board.
7. Do the same with the tomato. Be sure to get that pesky produce sticker!
8. Place the lettuce on the cutting board and begin peeling the layers off. Only peel as many layers as you need. One will be good for me.
9. Rip the lettuce into peices that will fit your bread. 
10. Set aside the ripped lettuce on a paper towel or place for later. 
11. Put the remaining lettuce in a ziplock bag and place back in the fridge.
12. Pick up your knife in the hand you cut things with.
13. Place your tomato on the cutting board. 
14. Slice your tomato as thin or thick as you would like. 
15. Slice as many slices as you would like. I'm going to do 3 thin slices. 
16. Place on a paper towel or place and set aside. 
17. Place your remaining tomato in a ziplock bag and place in the fridge.
18. Open the bread bag.
19. Pull out two slices of bread. 
20. Place both slices of bread inside the toaster. Toast them until desired darkness. I like my bread lightly toasted.
21. Once your bacon is cooked the way you like it (or not), place on a paper towel and set aside.
22. Place your remaining raw bacon inside a ziplock bag and put in the fridge.

### General Assembly
#### Are you hungry yet? I know I am! Also, did you like my pun?

1. Use a paper towel to wipe up the juices from the tomato on your cutting board.
2. Pull the toast slices from the toaster and place them on your cutting board.
3. If you are using mayo, open the mayo jar.
4. Pick up your butter knife, gather mayo on it, and spread the amount you will enjoy the most on your toast. I like a thin layer on each slice.
5. Place your butter knife back on the counter.
6. Add as many slices of bacon as you want to one of your slices of toast. I will use all 4 slices and I will break them in half.
7. Pick up your tomato slices, one at a time, and place them on top of your bacon.
8. Pick up your ripped lettuce, one peice at a time, and place them on top of your tomatoes.
9. Pick up your last peice of toast and place it mayo-side down on top of your lettuce.
10. Pick up your butter knife and cut your sandwich in half. I like to cut mine in triangles. 
11. Enjoy!
